    <div class="nested-copy-line-height lh-copy serif f4 nested-links mid-gray pr4-l w-two-thirds-l"><p>In July 2019, the NYC Department of Transportation (DOT) established a &ldquo;busway&rdquo; on the major crosstown street of 14th Street in Manhattan as a pilot project. In June 2020, it was made permanent. Here is an <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/html/brt/html/routes/14th-street.shtml">explanation</a> from the NYC DOT explaining how the busway works:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Every day between 6 AM and 10 PM, only buses, trucks and emergency vehicles may travel along Manhattan’s 14th Street between 3rd Avenue and 9th Avenue. All other vehicles may make local trips to access businesses, residences and garages along 14th Street, but drivers must make the next available right turn.</p>
<p>Between 10 PM to 6 AM, all vehicles may make thru trips along 14th Street.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Needless to say, this was a pretty major change. Under the new rules, cars and SUVs would still have access to 14th Street, but would have to make the first available right turn when driving on the street.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, there was a lot of opposition to this plan. Residents of surrounding streets filed a <a href="https://iapps.courts.state.ny.us/nyscef/ViewDocument?docIndex=ZQmRqXPrHmHJymaSSLuLLw==">lawsuit</a> trying to block the plan as described by <a href="https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2019/06/21/breaking-14th-street-landowners-sue-city-over-car-free-busway">Gersh Kuntzman in Streetsblog</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The 14th Street Coalition — which comprises property-owner groups in Tony Chelsea, the West Village and the Flatiron District — says that the Department of Transportation&rsquo;s proposed &ldquo;busway&rdquo; violates state environmental law because the agency didn&rsquo;t conduct a serious assessment of the impact that banning cars from 14th Street would have on neighboring residential streets.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Closing 14th Street to vehicular traffic would not only cause horrific traffic jams on 12th Street, 13th Street, 15th Street, 16th Street, 17th Street, 18th Street (a street with an MTA bus depot at the corner of Sixth Avenue), 19th Street, and 20th Street, it would also cause traffic on north-south avenues including Eighth, Seventh, Sixth, Fifth, Fourth, and Third Avenue, and Broadway, and Park Avenue,&rdquo; the suit, filed by lawyer Arthur Schwartz. &ldquo;The traffic will bring with it air pollution and noise pollution.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Judges <a href="https://ny.curbed.com/2019/8/9/20799317/judge-hits-brakes-14th-street-busway-dot-lawsuit">blocked</a> the busway a couple times, but the DOT ultimately won, and the changes went into effect.</p>
<p>So what happened after that? Did the predicted gridlock occur? Were peaceful neighboring streets transformed into a noisy and polluted standstill? The preliminary answer was clear, as documented in the New York Times: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/13/nyregion/14th-street-cars-banned.html">Nope.</a> As the article says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>That cars don’t necessarily clog neighboring streets when major crossways are closed off seems counterintuitive. But just as you might avoid leaving town on the Wednesday night before Thanksgiving because you assume everyone else is headed out, you are less likely to drive someplace where new restrictions will theoretically mean excess traffic. The fear is diversion, but the result is deterrence.</p>
<p>What seems to be happening on 14th Street so far is an inversion of what economists call “induced demand.’’ Time and time again it has been shown that when new roads are built or widened to reduce congestion, more drivers simply appear to take advantage of the added space.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is especially true when good transit options exist, which in this case are the M14-SBS and the L Train.</p>
<p>So five years later, how do things look? What&rsquo;s the latest on the 14th street busway discourse? Amazingly, there appears to be barely any discussion of the busway at all. A google search for &ldquo;14th street busway&rdquo; shows no articles published after 2020. There is some discussion on Reddit occasionally, but that seems to be it. No reports of local residents complaining about traffic on neighboring streets. No neighborhood associations trying to get the DOT to remove the busway.</p>
<p>The phrase &ldquo;No news is good news&rdquo; likely applies here. The DOT was right. The M14-SBS is faster, and the feared consequences never happened. The busway barely even exists in the minds of New Yorkers, except for a few transit obsessives like yours truly. Drivers quickly adapted, and everyone seems to be better off. And just like that, one corner of the city gets a lot less congested, and a just a little bit better.</p>
